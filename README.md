# pandas-challenge

In this challenge, I analyze data from 15 different schools based on type, size, budget and math/reading success rates.  The analysis shown in the notebook gives us the opportunity to try and optimize education in the future by figuring out which types, sizes, and budgets correlate directly to the highest success rates.
